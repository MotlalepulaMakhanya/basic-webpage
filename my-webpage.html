            <p>I would love to visit Cape Town because it is a dream destination for many people, viewing the Table Mountain and the sea are some of the things that attract me a lot. It is one of the biggest cities in Africa.With such a varying landscape - found in very few other places across the globe - Cape Town offers forests, beaches, gardens, mountains, oceans, grasslands, nature reserves, Winelands, as well as one of the most unique floral biomes in the world - fynbos</p>
